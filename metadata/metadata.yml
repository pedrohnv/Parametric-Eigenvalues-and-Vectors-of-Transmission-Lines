name: Parametric Eigenvalues and Vectors of Transmission Lines
description: This capsule has a notebook that compares some algorithms to obtain an
  unshuffled set of eigen values and vectors to allow a parametric analysis of them.
  It uses the telegrapher's equation for a multiconductor transmission line as contextual
  example.
